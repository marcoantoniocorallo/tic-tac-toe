# XOX Tic-Tac-Toe(c)! OXO

---

That's a simple tic-tac-toe game, developed in Python by means of the `Tkinter` library as excercise of the _Advanced Software Engineering_ course @ University of Pisa

The aim of this project was to think about personas and scenarios, develop user stories and implement them as features of the game: the game `indicates whose turn it is`, `who (and which combo) won`, `checks for invalid moves` and `recognizes ties`.
